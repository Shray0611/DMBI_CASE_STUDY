✈️ Airline Price Optimization Dashboard & DSS (v3)

Project Overview

This project is a complete Decision Support System (DSS) and Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard designed for an airline's pricing strategy team. It addresses the need to optimize ticket prices by analyzing key market factors, using a machine learning model trained on a large dataset of flight information.

This application directly implements the following project goals:

Predictive Modeling: Applies Regression Analysis (using a RandomForestRegressor) to predict flight fares.

Seasonal Trends: The model and dashboard analyze pricing based on the month and quarter of travel.

Competitor Pricing: The BI dashboard allows for monitoring and comparing prices across different airlines and cabin classes.

Booking Patterns: The system analyzes how price changes as the number of "days left" before the flight decreases.

Demand Elasticity: The dashboard provides a proxy for demand elasticity by comparing fares across different cabin classes (e.g., Economy vs. Business).

Dynamic Price Adjustments: The DSS tab recommends a dynamic price based on all the above factors, allowing a manager to make informed pricing decisions.

Features

The application is a multi-tab Streamlit dashboard:

1. Decision Support System (Price Predictor)

Dynamic Price Recommendation: Recommends a ticket price in real-time based on selected flight parameters.

Comprehensive Inputs: Allows selection of Airline, Route (Source/Destination), Class, Total Stops, and Departure Time.

Seasonal Awareness: Automatically calculates the journey date and Booking Quarter (e.g., Q1, Q4) based on the "Days Left" slider and feeds this crucial seasonal data to the model.

2. Business Intelligence Dashboard (Analytics)

Seasonal Trends Analysis: Includes bar charts for average price by Quarter and line charts for average price by Month.

Competitor Price Analysis: A powerful, interactive, grouped bar chart (using Altair) that displays the average fare for every airline, broken down by cabin class (Economy, Business, etc.).

Booking Patterns: A line chart visualizing the price curve, showing the relationship between average fare and the number of "Days Left" until departure.

Demand Elasticity Proxy: A bar chart comparing the average fares of different cabin classes to highlight differences in pricing power.

Top Routes: A chart showing the Top 15 most expensive flight routes by average fare.

Tech Stack & Requirements

Python 3.8+

Streamlit: For the interactive web app and dashboard.

Pandas: For data loading and manipulation.

Scikit-learn: For the machine learning pipeline (StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder) and the RandomForestRegressor model.

Altair: For advanced, interactive data visualizations.

Joblib: For saving and loading the trained model pipeline.

How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

Step 1: Set Up the Project

Ensure you have Python 3.8 or newer installed.

Place your Cleaned_dataset.csv file inside the data/ folder.

Place v2_preprocess_and_train.py inside the scripts/ folder.

Place v3_app.py and v3_requirements.txt in the main project folder.

Step 2: Install Dependencies

Open your terminal in the main project folder (my_airline_project/) and run:

pip install -r v3_requirements.txt


Step 3: Train the Model (Run This Once)

The training script will load the data, engineer features (like 'Journey_quarter'), and save the complete model pipeline to the models/ folder.

python scripts/v2_preprocess_and_train.py


(This may take several minutes as it trains on a large dataset).

You should see a confirmation that models/airline_price_pipeline_v2.pkl has been saved.

Step 4: Run the Streamlit App

Once the model is trained, you can start the application:

streamlit run v3_app.py


Your app will open in your default web browser.

Model & Performance

Algorithm: RandomForestRegressor with 100 trees, max_depth=20, and min_samples_leaf=10.

Features: The model is trained on Days_left, Journey_month, Journey_day, Airline, Class, Source, Departure, Total_stops, Destination, and Journey_quarter.

Performance: The model achieves an R2 Score of ~0.92, meaning it explains ~92% of the price variance. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is approximately ₹3,225, which is the average error of its price predictions.
